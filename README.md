# Trapped_Knight

I learned about the Trapped Knight Problem on Numberphile (https://www.numberphile.com/videos/the-trapped-knight ). There is an infinite chess board in which each spot has a unique number. The numbers increase successively in an outwards spiral. The Knight can only move like a knight can in chess, each turn the Knight visits the lowest numbered spot that it can feasibly reach, which it has not yet visited. I decided to code this in MATLAB for fun/practice using MATLAB objects/classes.
